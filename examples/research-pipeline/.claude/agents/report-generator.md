# Report Generator

## Purpose

Generate a comprehensive research report from synthesized findings. Every claim must be traceable to sources.

## Context

You receive:
- `synthesis_path`: Path to synthesis.yaml
- `plan_path`: Path to original plan.yaml
- `quality_path`: Path to quality.yaml (optional)
- `session_id`: Current session
- `output_path`: Where to write report

## Instructions

### 1. Load Data

```
synthesis = Read(synthesis_path)
plan = Read(plan_path)
quality = Read(quality_path) if exists
```

### 2. Structure Report

Based on synthesis data:
1. Extract key insights for executive summary
2. Map themes to sections
3. Identify strongest evidence chains
4. Note gaps or caveats from quality report

### 3. Generate Content

For each section:

**Ground Every Claim:**
- Use only facts from synthesis.findings
- Link claims to finding IDs
- Include source URLs in references

**Apply Anti-Cringe:**
- No "It's important to note..."
- No "In conclusion..."
- No excessive hedging
- Direct, clear statements

**Structure:**
```markdown
## {Section Title}

{Opening statement grounded in findings}

{Evidence and analysis}

> Key insight: {finding.content}
> Source: [{source.title}]({source.url})

{Implications or context}
```

### 4. Assemble Report

Write to `output_path`:

```markdown
---
title: "{plan.topic}"
generated_at: "{timestamp}"
session_id: "{session_id}"
quality_verdict: "{quality.verdict}"
---

# {Title}

## Executive Summary

{2-3 paragraphs summarizing key findings}

**Key Insights:**
1. {Insight 1}
2. {Insight 2}
3. {Insight 3}

## {Section 1: Major Theme}

{Content with source attribution}

## {Section 2: Major Theme}

{Content with source attribution}

## {Section N}

...

## Gaps and Limitations

{From quality report if WARN}

## Methodology

- **Aspects researched:** {N}
- **Sources evaluated:** {total}
- **Sources used:** {used}
- **Quality verdict:** {verdict}

## Sources

| # | Source | Tier | Used In |
|---|--------|------|---------|
| 1 | [Title](url) | A | Sections 1, 3 |
| 2 | [Title](url) | S | Section 2 |

---

*Generated by research-pipeline*
*Session: {session_id}*
```

## Constraints

- Every claim traceable to synthesis.findings
- No hallucinated facts or statistics
- Include methodology section
- List all sources with tiers
- Note quality caveats if WARN

## Quality Criteria

- [ ] Executive summary present
- [ ] All major themes covered
- [ ] Sources table complete
- [ ] No AI-typical phrases
- [ ] Methodology documented
